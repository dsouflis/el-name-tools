## Synopsis
El-name-tools is a package assembling a set of tools to work with Greek names.

- It can recognize around 2000 forms of around 1200 male and female given names, present in its name dictionary
- It can do so in the presence of usual misspellings, since matching is done using the phonetic rendering of the names
- It can calculate namedays for specific years (data for 2019 - 2049 are included)
- It can recognize the gender of any Greek name, regardless of its presence in the aforementioned dictionary
- It can form the vocative form of any Greek name, regardless of its presence in the aforementioned dictionary
- Optionally, it can form the vocative of the Canonical given name of the form, if it is found in the dictionary

## Usage
### Including the package
```ecmascript 6
import {nametools} from 'el-name-tools';
```
### Recognizing a name
This function identifies the name in the name dictionary and returns
its stored data and its computed namedays for all years specified 
during initialization.
```ecmascript 6
let name = nametools.recognizeName('Πάνος');
/* Results in:
{ name: 'Πάνος',
  skeleton: 'πανοσ',
  allnames:
   [ 'Παναγιώτης', 'Πάνος', 'Πανίκος', 'Γιώτης', 'Τάκης', 'Πανούσος' ],
  namedays:
   [ { case: 'fixed', date: '1970-08-15' },
     { case: 'fixed', date: '1970-12-26' },
     { case: 'fixed', date: '1970-04-21' } ],
  gender: 'MALE' 
}
*/ 
``` 
`.allnames[0]` is the Canonical given name for this entry.

### Computing namedays for a range of years
```ecmascript 6
            const namedayDates =  nametools.calculateNamedays(nameData, 2020, 2020)
const namedayDateΜillis = namedayDates[2020].map(
    d => d.getTime());
/* namedayDates is something like:
{ '2020':
  [ 2020-08-15T00:00:00.000Z,
    2020-12-26T00:00:00.000Z,
    2020-04-21T00:00:00.000Z ] 
}
 */
```

### Recognizing and computing the vocative
This function identifies the name in the name dictionary and computes
the vocative of its recognized form, 
or else computes the vocative based on its form.
```ecmascript 6
let name = nametools.recognizeAndGetVocative('Πανήκος');
// Results in 'Πανίκο'
```

### Recognizing and computing the normalized vocative
This function identifies the name in the name dictionary and computes
the vocative of its normalized form, 
or else computes the vocative based on its form.
```ecmascript 6
let name = nametools.recognizeAndGetNormalizedVocative('Πανήκος');
// Results in 'Παναγιώτη'
```

### Recognizing and computing the gender
This function identifies the name in the name dictionary and returns its gender, 
or else computes the gender based on its form.
```ecmascript 6
let name = nametools.recognizeAndGetGender('Πανήκος');
// Results in 'MALE'
```

### Computing the vocative using the form of the name
```ecmascript 6
let gender = nametools.getVocative('Πανήκος');
// Results in 'Πανήκο'
``` 

### Computing the gender using the form of the name
```ecmascript 6
let gender = nametools.getGender('Μπούλα');
// Results in 'FEMALE'
``` 

### Phonetic Skeleton
The phonetic skeleton is the phonetic rendering of its argument, which must be a Greek word.
```ecmascript 6
let skel = nametools.phoneticSkeleton('αιλουρος');
// Results in 'ελUροσ'
```
